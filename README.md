## Overview

`vibez` is a command-line tool that extracts file contents for use with LLMs.

## Motivation

The developer AI workflow is messy. There are _many_ tools that integrate across the different stages of development and layers of the stack. Some tools are more powerful, but bloated, expensive, and tightly coupled with IDEs. For most prompts, you may only have a few requirements and only need to provide a limited amount of [context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model#Prompt_engineering,_attention_mechanism,_and_context_window). `vibez` is a pragmatic solution. Simply copy the file contents you need and use whatever AI tool you prefer.

## Installation

Install with `pipx`:

```sh
pipx install vibez
```

Or from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/williamgrosset/vibez.git
cd vibez
pip install .
```

## Usage

```sh
vibez [OPTIONS] <file|file:range|directory> [...]
```

### Options

- `[-r | --recursive]`: Recursively process directories.
- `[-i | --ignore] "item1,item2,..."`: Ignore files or directories.
- `[-o | --output] <output.md>`: Save output to a file.
- `[-s | --summary] "Your summary"`: Add a summary.

### Examples

#### Extract a single file to clipboard

```sh
vibez file.py
```

#### Extract specific lines from a file

```sh
vibez file.py:5-15
```

#### Extract multiple files and directories

```sh
vibez notes.md file.py src/
```

#### Recursively extract from a directory

```sh
vibez -r src/
```

#### Ignore files or directories

```sh
vibez -r dir/ -i "dir/.gitignore,dir/.git"
```

#### Save output to a file

```sh
vibez -o output.md file.py
```

#### Add a summary

```sh
vibez -s "Add login functionality" auth.py
```
